Netcat

You can also use Netcat to create a simple command-line messaging server instantly. As in the previous usage example, nc must be installed on both systems used for the chat room.

On one system, run the following command to create the chat server listening on port 5000.

$ nc -l -vv -p 5000

On the other system, run the following command to launch a chat session to a machine where the messaging server is running.

$ nc 192.168.56.1 5000



nc -lnvp 1337 : to start listening
