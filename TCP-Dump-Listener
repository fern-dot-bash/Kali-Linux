TCP-Dump-Listener

Start a tcpdump listener on your local machine:

example:

sudo tcpdump ip proto \\icmp -i tun0



extra note:

Now, use the command "ping [local THM ip] -c 1" through the telnet session to see if we're able to execute system commands. Do we receive any pings? Note, you need to preface this with .RUN (Y/N)

.RUN ping $ip -c 1 

after running telnet on the victim
